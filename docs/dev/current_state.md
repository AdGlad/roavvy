# Roavvy — Development State (as of 2026-03-12)

## What Works

The Flutter mobile app runs on a real iPhone and successfully scans the photo library to detect visited countries.

**Confirmed working end-to-end:**
- Photo library permission request (iOS Photos framework)
- PhotoKit asset fetch with `fetchLimit` and `sinceDate` incremental-scan predicate
- GPS coordinate extraction from EXIF metadata — streamed as per-photo records via `EventChannel('roavvy/photo_scan/events')`
- **CLGeocoder fully removed** — all country resolution is now offline, via `packages/country_lookup`
- Swift streams `{lat, lng, capturedAt}` per photo in batches of 50; Dart resolves coordinates to ISO codes on a background `Isolate`
- Scan stats display: assets inspected, with/without location, geocode successes/failures, unique countries
- Progress indicator during scanning (indeterminate `LinearProgressIndicator` + processed-photo counter)
- Per-country photo counts and `firstSeen`/`lastSeen` ranges populated from `capturedAt`
- Country visit persistence via Drift SQLite — three typed tables (`inferred_country_visits`, `user_added_countries`, `user_removed_countries`) — survives app restart
- Review screen: remove a detected country, manually add a country (2-letter ISO code), save the corrected list
- User edits (add / remove) are written as typed records; removals create `UserRemovedCountry` tombstones that suppress future scan results
- 18 widget/unit tests passing in `widget_test.dart`; full suite ~124 tests

**`packages/country_lookup` — implemented and wired into the app:**
- Offline GPS → ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 resolution via point-in-polygon lookup
- Custom compact binary format (`ne_countries.bin`) with 1° grid spatial index — 1.2 MB, 233 countries, 1580 polygons
- `initCountryLookup(Uint8List)` + `resolveCountry(double, double)` public API
- Zero external dependencies; pure Dart
- Python build script (`tool/build_geodata.py`) processes Natural Earth 1:50m shapefile into binary asset
- `tool/source/` (shapefile) and `tool/.venv/` (Python env) are gitignored per `GEODATA.md`
- 20 tests passing; all known-city, null-return, out-of-range, and binary format cases covered
- **Wired into the app** — `ne_countries.bin` bundled as Flutter asset; `main.dart` calls `initCountryLookup` at startup before `runApp`
- CLGeocoder still active for scanning — removal is Task 3+4

## Domain Model

`packages/shared_models` defines the canonical domain types. The model is split into three write-side input records and two read-side projections:

| Type | Role | File |
|---|---|---|
| `InferredCountryVisit` | Country detected from photo GPS by the scan pipeline | `src/inferred_country_visit.dart` |
| `UserAddedCountry` | Country explicitly added by the user | `src/user_added_country.dart` |
| `UserRemovedCountry` | Permanent tombstone — suppresses inference forever | `src/user_removed_country.dart` |
| `EffectiveVisitedCountry` | Computed read model; one per code; never stored | `src/effective_visited_country.dart` |
| `ScanSummary` | Pipeline metrics + inferred visits from one scan run | `src/scan_summary.dart` |

The effective set is computed by `effectiveVisitedCountries()` (`src/effective_visit_merge.dart`):
1. Build a removal set from all `UserRemovedCountry` records — these suppress everything.
2. Merge `InferredCountryVisit` records by country code across scan runs (earliest `firstSeen`, latest `lastSeen`, summed `photoCount`).
3. Apply `UserAddedCountry` records for any code not in the removal set.

`CountryVisit`, `VisitSource`, and `effectiveVisits()` have been fully retired (Task 5). Only the typed model remains.

## Next Milestones (priority order)

1. ~~**Generate `ne_countries.bin`**~~ — ✓ Complete. Binary generated (1.2 MB), bundled as Flutter asset, `initCountryLookup` called in `main.dart` at startup.

2. ~~**Drift SQLite persistence**~~ — ✓ Complete (Task 2). Three Drift tables, `VisitRepository`, `scan_mapper` updated, `shared_preferences` removed.

3. ~~**Background isolate + streaming + CLGeocoder removal**~~ — ✓ Complete (Tasks 3+4). EventChannel streams per-photo GPS; Dart `Isolate.run` resolves via `country_lookup`; CLGeocoder removed; progress bar wired.

4. ~~**Typed domain model migration**~~ — ✓ Complete (Task 5). `CountryVisit`, `VisitSource`, `effectiveVisits()` fully retired.

5. ~~**`loadPolygons()` API in `country_lookup`**~~ — ✓ Complete (Task 6, Milestone 6). `CountryPolygon` exported; 7 new tests; 27 total in package.

6. **World map screen** — Task 7 next. `flutter_map` + polygon rendering + visited/unvisited styling. ADR-017/018/019 written and approved by Architect.

7. **Firebase sync**, **achievements**, **sharing cards**, **Shopify** — subsequent milestones.

## Spike Limitations (explicit — to be fixed before shipping)

| Limitation | ADR | Replacement | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLGeocoder: network-required, rate-limited, locale-dependent country names | ADR-009 | `packages/country_lookup` | ✓ Done — CLGeocoder fully removed |
| `shared_preferences`: single JSON blob, no querying, no migration | ADR-011 | Drift SQLite | ✓ Done (Task 2) |
| Single aggregate IPC call: no streaming, no progress | ADR-010 | Background isolate + EventChannel | ✓ Done (Tasks 3+4) |
| `CountryVisit` as storage format: invalid combinations possible | ADR-008 | Retire after Drift migration | ✓ Done (Task 5) |
| `firstSeen` / `lastSeen` not populated | ADR-013 | Extend Swift bridge contract | ✓ Done — populated from `capturedAt` per photo |
| `geocodeAttempts` == `assetsWithLocation` | ADR-013 | Extend Swift bridge contract | ✓ Done — `geocodeSuccesses` = resolved photo count |
